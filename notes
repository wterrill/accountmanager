Delete the podfile.lock file from the ios folder.
Open the terminal, go to the ios folder directory and run pod install. It could take some time to install.
If pod install gives any error then try this
pod install --repo-update 
After everything is done run your project again
flutter run


flutter packages pub run build_runner build
